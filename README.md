# Bank-Deposit-Machine-Learning-R

To perform statistical analyses using Machine Learning in R on the sample attached dataset. 

**Objectives**

**Understanding the Business Context**

Market Sizing and Scenario Analysis: Determine the potential market size for deposits and create scenarios based on different market conditions or customer segments.

Partner-Relationship Analysis: Analyze the data to understand which types of clients (job, education level, marital status, etc.) are more likely to subscribe to a deposit and how these characteristics correlate with other factors like housing loans or personal loans.

Product Development or Innovations Assessment: Assess the potential for new products or innovations in the deposits domain, such as different types of deposit schemes targeting specific customer segments.

**Analyzing the Portfolio and Product Economics**

Portfolio Deep-Dives: Perform an in-depth analysis of the existing deposit subscribers. This could involve segmenting customers based on various attributes and understanding the characteristics of each segment.

Profitability Valuation for Deposits: Calculate the profitability of deposits. This could involve analyzing the balance, duration of the deposit, and other relevant factors.

Statistical Techniques: Use various statistical techniques for these analyses, such as regression analysis, cluster analysis, and predictive modeling.

Long-Term Recommendations for Business Growth: Based on the analysis, make strategic recommendations for long-term business growth.

Highlighting Risks and Opportunities: Identify potential risks and opportunities from the data and suggest action plans.
